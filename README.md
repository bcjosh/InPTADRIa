Indian Pulsar Timing Array Experiment : Data Release Ia
====================================================================================

Indian Pulsar Timing Array Experiment (InPTA) is pulsar timing experiment 
searching for low frequency nanoHz Gravitational Waves in operation 
since 2016. InPTA is a Indo-Japanese collaboration which makes use of 
the unique capabilities of the upgraded Giant Meterwave Radio 
Telescope (uGMRT) for monitoring a sample of nearby millisecond 
pulsars for this purpose. 

This Data Release Ia is the first release of high precision Dispersion Measure (DM) 
measurements obtained as part of the experiment. InPTA DRIa covers three years between 
2018-2021.
