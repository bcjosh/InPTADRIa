Indian Pulsar Timing Array Experiment : Data Release Ia
====================================================================================

Indian Pulsar Timing Array Experiment (InPTA) is pulsar timing experiment 
searching for low frequency nanoHz Gravitational Waves in operation 
since 2016. InPTA is a Indo-Japanese collaboration which makes use of 
the unique capabilities of the upgraded Giant Meterwave Radio 
Telescope (uGMRT) for monitoring a sample of nearby millisecond 
pulsars for this purpose. 

This Data Release Ia is the first release of high precision Dispersion Measure (DM) 
measurements obtained as part of the experiment. InPTA DRIa covers three years between 
2018-2021.

=====================================================================================

The DM time-series of 5 pulsars is available in this repository. The included pulsars 
are 
PSR J1643-1224
PSR J1713+0747
PSR J1909-3744
PSR J1939+2134
PSR J2145-0750

=========================================================================================
The DM time-series is available in an ASCII file named after the pulsar
Jmmmm+nnnn.DMtimeseries.dat

Each file is stuctured as below

Col 1       :      MJD
Col 2       :      Dispersion Measure (pc-cm^-3)
Col 3       :      Uncertainity in Dispersion Measure (pc-cm^-3)
Col 4       :      Chisquare
